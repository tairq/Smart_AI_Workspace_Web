# Screenshot Workflow

Puppeteer is installed at `C:/Users/ast/AppData/Local/Temp/puppeteer-test/`. Chrome cache is at `C:/Users/ast/.cache/puppeteer/`.

Always screenshot from localhost: `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000`

Screenshots are saved automatically to `./temporary screenshots/screenshot-N.png` (auto-incremented, never overwritten).

Optional label suffix: `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000 label` → saves as `screenshot-N-label.png`

`screenshot.mjs` lives in the project root. Use it as-is.

After screenshotting, read the PNG from `temporary screenshots/` with the Read tool — Claude can see and analyze the image directly.

When comparing, be specific: "heading is 32px but reference shows ~24px", "card gap is 16px but should be 24px"

Check: spacing/padding, font size/weight/line-height, colors (exact hex), alignment, border-radius, shadows, image sizing
